# Hi there! I'm Tim

I am the founder of **[space+ultra](https://spaceplusultra.com)** — a Berlin-based AI Product Lab. We don't just build software; we architect intelligent systems to solve the web's most complex interaction challenges. Our approach is rooted in systems thinking, where we deconstruct business processes to their foundational level and design AI-native solutions for real-world impact.

Our "Lab-to-Product" model is core to how we operate. We engage in deep, strategic R&D partnerships to validate core hypotheses and generate proprietary insights. This hardened expertise is then channeled into our own commercial products.
Our flagship product, em•dash, is the embodiment of this philosophy. It is a proactive AI agent that understands "digital body language" to turn unspoken user intent into qualified leads and measurable revenue for B2B SaaS companies.
We build governable, stateful, and outcome-driven AI.

🌟 **My Focus**: As a Lead Product Manager I am committed to crafting innovative and sustainable digital solutions that address complex challenges with precision and a data-driven mindset.

## 🌌 Why **space+ultra**?

The name **space+ultra** reflects our vision of pushing boundaries and exploring new dimensions in urban technology and design.

- **"Space"** symbolizes the environments we work with—urban spaces, architectural designs, and digital landscapes. It represents the core of our work: understanding and shaping spaces for better functionality and sustainability.  
- **"Ultra"** signifies going beyond—beyond limits, expectations, and conventional solutions. It highlights our commitment to innovation, creativity, and delivering exceptional results.  

Additionally, the name draws inspiration from the phrase **"non plus ultra"**, meaning "nothing further beyond." Historically, it symbolized the edge of the known world and the pursuit of the ultimate.

Together, **space+ultra** embodies a forward-thinking approach to solving complex challenges and striving for excellence.
