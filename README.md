# Hi there! I'm Tim.
I am the founder of **[space+ultra](https://spaceplusultra.com)** — a Berlin-based AI Product Lab. We don't just build software; we architect intelligent, stateful, and outcome-driven AI systems that solve the web's most complex interaction challenges.

Our approach is rooted in systems thinking. We deconstruct business processes to their foundational level and design AI-native solutions that drive real-world impact.

-   **Our "Lab-to-Product" Model:** We engage in deep R&D partnerships to validate core hypotheses and generate proprietary insights. This hardened expertise is then channeled into our own commercial products.
-   **Our Flagship Product:** `em•dash` is the embodiment of this philosophy. It's a proactive AI agent that reads "digital body language," moves beyond correlation to understand **Causal AI**, and turns unspoken user intent into measurable revenue for B2B SaaS companies.

### 🌟 Core Expertise

As a 0→1 product architect, I bridge the gap between deep R&D and go-to-market strategy. My expertise is focused on:

-   **AI-Native Product Strategy:** Building products from zero, centered on AI capabilities.
-   **Causal & Proactive AI:** Designing systems that move beyond passive analytics to understand *why* and *proactively act*.
-   **B2B SaaS Revenue Engines:** Architecting solutions (like `em•dash`) that directly address conversion and revenue.
-   **Systems Thinking:** Deconstructing complex problems into governable, stateful components.

### 🌌 Why **space+ultra**?

The name reflects our mission of pushing boundaries and exploring new dimensions in data and AI.

-   **"Space"** represents the **digital space** where 98% of user interactions happen unseen. It's the "space" of anonymous user behavior and unspoken intent—the "digital body language" that most companies fail to read. We architect systems that finally read that room.
-   **"Ultra"** signifies our commitment to go beyond conventional solutions. It's our drive to move...
    -   Beyond passive analytics to **proactive engagement**.
    -   Beyond simple Correlation to find deep **Causality**.
    -   Beyond just *insights* to create measurable *impact*.

Inspired by "non plus ultra" (nothing further beyond), **space+ultra** is our mission to push past the known edge of analytics and redefine what's possible with AI.
